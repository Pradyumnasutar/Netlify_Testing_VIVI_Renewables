          A solar pump is a result of photovoltaic technology converting solar energy into electricity,
          helping the motor and pump to run. The power generates ample amounts of energy to draw water
          from the borewell, river, lake, or pond to the lands.

        <p className="text-center">
          To understand more scientifically, the execution of the whole process starts with the photovoltaic
          cells in solar modules that convert sunlight into Direct Current (DC) electrical energy. This DC energy
          is then fed to the Motor Pump Set via Pump Controller in case of DC pumps or via Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)
          in case of AC pumps (VFD controls the speed of the motor). The pumping system is a combination of an impeller
          and a motor; the impeller propels water movement, and the motor drives the pump. The water finally is propelled
          out of the borewell/river/lake/pond through the pipe so that water can then be fed to the fields for irrigation
          and other purposes.

          Even though the water output varies during the day depending upon varying solar irradiance, yet it does not cause major issues
          and gives various benefits in return; to count a few of the perks, the solar pump sets us free from the high expenses of diesel
          and helps higher yield during the daytime when crops get all the necessary ingredients â€“ sunlight and water!

          <p>
            It helps people to output water across all seasons to cultivate multiple crops every year all at the cost 
            of the one-time investment and then zero running costs (free sunlight) for many years to come! It makes it 
            easier for farmers to cultivate the land during the daytime rather than at night when the grid remains erratic. 
            Even the drip and sprinkler systems can be connected with the solar system to further improve crop yield.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hardest part of any system is the maintenance; the solar system needs no maintenance except regular 
            cleaning of the modules. As there are no consumables, therefore it adds to the ease of operation. As the 
            water can be harnessed at any time of the day, the user can plan their other activities independently which 
            might add to the relief. Not only is it a relief to the people but also the environment as it contributes 
            to the reduction of carbon emissions and pollution.

            Before using, it is necessary for the user to check the connections and cables periodically for any damages and reports.
            Apart from that, one must always operate the controller with dry hands due to the obvious risk of electric shock.
