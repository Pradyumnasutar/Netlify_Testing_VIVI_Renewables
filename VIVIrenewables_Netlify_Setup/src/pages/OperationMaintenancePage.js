          If you are missing out on Operations and Maintenance (O&M), then you probably need to rethink the promised results that this system provides you with. 
          Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is an integral part of any Rooftop Solar PV System. O&M is responsible for increasing the plantâ€™s lifetime and maintaining 
          efficiency as long as the system works. You might not recognize the importance of efficiency and machine life, but when it comes to safety, it becomes undeniable. 
          Since an RTPV system is an electrical system with both AC and DC components usually at appreciably high voltages, safety also becomes a prime concern for which 
          proper O&M must be performed. By ensuring O&M at appropriate time intervals, one can minimize losses and increase energy production from the plant. 
          O&M mainly applies to rooftop plants, but some of these are equally applicable to larger ground-mounted plants as well.

          Before coming to us as a provider, the system also has things to give out apart from the regular action. It provides you with annual reports & circulation 
          to the user on performance of their power plant. And, even before that, they are provided with the plant performance analysis on a monthly basis.
        </p>
        <p className="section-text">
          From our side, REI INFRA gives out all tools & tackles required for cleaning. We are also quick solution makers, if there is any troubleshooting of the plant in case 
          of any abnormal behaviour/any breakdown, our representative will reach the site within 24 hours and the fault should be resolved within 48 hours apart 
          from the issues related to replacement of modules & inverters.
        </p>
        <p className="section-text">
          There is also constant coordination with vendors and suppliers for under-warranty replacement/rectification of defects in inverters, PV modules, cables, 
          electrical and mechanical equipment as well as for any installed parts!
